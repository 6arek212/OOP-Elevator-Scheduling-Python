![Builds](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/workflows/Builds/badge.svg)
#### A part of university assignment 


</br>



## Project Overview
Giving a Bulding with elevators and a set of calls , the program needs to allocate the calls to the elevator in a way that minimize the waiting time

</br>





## Built With

* Pycharm 
* Python

</br>



## Algorithms

### What is needed 
- allocate calls algorithm 
- elevator movement
- elevator data structure 
- use json files 
- main function to spin the program 

</br>

### About the allocation algorithm
- Picking the elevator with the best time to get to the given call , taking in considiration the elevator current calls 
- Round Robin (circle allocate)

</br>

### About elevator scheduling
Using a variation of **LOOK** algorithm in which the elevator keep serving till the last call then changes its direction
