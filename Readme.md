![Builds](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/workflows/Builds/badge.svg)


#### A part of university assignment 


# Project Overview
Giving a Bulding with elevators and a set of calls , the program needs to allocate the calls to the elevator in a way that minimize the waiting time



#### What is needed 
- allocate calls algorithm 
- elevator movement 
- use json files 


### About the allocation algorithm
- Picking the elevator with the best time to get the given call 
- Round Robin (circle allocate)
