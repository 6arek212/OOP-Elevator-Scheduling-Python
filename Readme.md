# **Elevator Scheduling Algorithms**
![Builds](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/workflows/Builds/badge.svg)
#### A part of university assignment 


</br>



## Project Overview
Giving a Bulding with elevators and a set of calls , the program needs to allocate the calls to the elevator in a way that minimize the waiting time


</br>

## Implementation & What is need to be done

#### What is needed 
- allocate calls algorithm 
- elevator movement 
- use json files 

</br>

#### About the allocation algorithm
- Picking the elevator with the best time to get the given call 
- Round Robin (circle allocate)

</br>

#### About elevator scheduling
Using a variation of **LOOK** algorithm in which the elevator keeps serving till the last call then changes its direction
